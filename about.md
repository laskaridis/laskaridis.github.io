I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. I studied computer
science in [University of Indianapolis](http://www.uindy.edu) from which
I earned my B.Sc.

For over a decade I have been delivering software for businesses in diverse
industries and sectors. My expertise lies in object-oriented analysis, design and
implementation of enterprise software systems. I am passionate abount using
technology to transform challenging problems into empowering solutions and
crafting exciting ideas into beautiful products.

For the past few years I am a part of a great team in [mytrip.com](http://www.mytrip.com),
with whom I create new experiences for travellers around the world.

I live in Athens along with my loving wife Irene. When not working I like to
spend time with my friends and family.
