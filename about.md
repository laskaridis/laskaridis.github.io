I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece. I earned my B.Sc. in 
computer science from [University of Indianapolis](http://www.uindy.edu).

For over a decade I have been delivering software for businesses in diverse
industries and sectors. My expertise lies in object-oriented analysis, design
and implementation of distributed software systems.

I am passionate about using technology to transform challenging problems
into empowering solutions and crafting exciting ideas into beautiful products.

For the past few years I am a part of a great team in [mytrip.com](http://www.mytrip.com),
with whom I create new experiences for travellers around the world.

I am married and living in Athens, Greece.
